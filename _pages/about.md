My name is Joshua Masters, I am a recent Computer Science Graduate who is seeking a software developer role in tech or biomedical industries. I have primary experience in web application development that were developed with AGILE methodoligies along with Git and Jira tools to ensure efficient sprints/cycles.

When I am not strengthening my career skills, I spend my free time playing music in the form of voice, guitar, and piano. I have plenty of fun facts from my ability to solve a rubik's cube in under two minutes to my love of animals that stemmed from raising bunnies in 4-H. 

I grew up in Chagrin Falls, OH, attending Kenston Schools and moved down to Columbus when I graduated high school right before heading to Dayton for college at the University of Dayton.

Feel free to check out some of my projects/experience on this website, on my LinkedIn, and on my GitHub below:

 Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
